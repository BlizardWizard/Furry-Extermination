# Discord Image Filter
The official Image Filter Discord bot

<hr/>

Uses the Discord API to interact with Discord to collect sent images, and then uses the GoogleVision API to scan images and collect relevant tags. Then images are deleted from Discord chat based on if tags on the image match tags in a filter list for each server. Similar system found in [AnimeGuard](https://github.com/BlizardWizard/AnimeGuard).

API usage: used Google APIs and integreted mutiple apis into one service.
