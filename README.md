# Discord Image Filter
The official Image Filter Discord bot

<hr/>

Used the Discord API to interact with Discord to collect sent images, and used the GoogleVision API to scan images and collect revevant tags. Then images would be deleted from Discord chat based on if tags on the image matched tags in a filter list for each server. Similar system found in [AnimeGuard](https://github.com/BlizardWizard/AnimeGuard).

Learned about how Google API's work and integrating mutiple apis into one service.
