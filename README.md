# Furry-Xtermination
The official Furry Xterminator Discord bot

<hr/>

Used the Discord API to interact with Discord to collect sent images, and used the GoogleVision API to scan images and collect revevant tags. Then images would be deleted from Discord chat based on if tags on the image matched tags in a filter list for each server. Similar system found in [AnimeGuuard](https://github.com/BlizardWizard/AnimeGuard).

Learned about how Google API's work and integrating mutiple apis into one service.


## Project Canceled
Project ultimately closed because Google API's require a credit card linked billing account in order to precess any requests. Project got to the point of the Discord bot running and connecting to the server and images being fed to GoogleVision, but was not able to scan images.
